## Please note

This library was created for use within a specific project of mine, and was largely programmed with the help of [Kiro](https://kiro.dev). It is possible that there are bugs and/or use cases not covered; I have only verified that it works for what I need. This is why the library is not uploaded to the crate repository at this time.

Please feel free to try out and use this library at your own risk, and report and/or fix any issues you encounter.
