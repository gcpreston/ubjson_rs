# Requirements Document

## Introduction

This feature involves creating a comprehensive Rust library for reading and writing Universal Binary JSON (UBJSON) format data. UBJSON is a binary JSON format that provides efficient serialization and deserialization of JSON-like data structures with type safety and container optimizations. The library will support all UBJSON data types, container optimization features, and provide a clean API for Rust developers.

## Requirements

### Requirement 1

**User Story:** As a Rust developer, I want to serialize Rust data structures to UBJSON format, so that I can efficiently store and transmit structured data in a compact binary format.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a user calls the serialize function with a supported Rust data type THEN the system SHALL convert it to valid UBJSON binary format
2. WHEN serializing primitive types (null, bool, integers, floats, strings) THEN the system SHALL use the appropriate UBJSON type markers and encoding
3. WHEN serializing collections (arrays, objects) THEN the system SHALL properly encode container structures with correct length prefixes
4. IF container optimization is enabled THEN the system SHALL use optimized container formats when all elements are the same type
5. WHEN serialization fails due to unsupported types THEN the system SHALL return a descriptive error

### Requirement 2

**User Story:** As a Rust developer, I want to deserialize UBJSON data back into Rust data structures, so that I can work with the data in a type-safe manner.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a user provides valid UBJSON binary data THEN the system SHALL parse it into corresponding Rust data structures
2. WHEN encountering UBJSON type markers THEN the system SHALL correctly interpret and convert them to appropriate Rust types
3. WHEN parsing containers THEN the system SHALL handle both standard and optimized container formats
4. IF the UBJSON data is malformed or corrupted THEN the system SHALL return a descriptive parsing error
5. WHEN parsing is successful THEN the system SHALL return the deserialized data with correct type information

### Requirement 3

**User Story:** As a performance-conscious developer, I want the library to support UBJSON container optimizations, so that I can achieve maximum efficiency when working with homogeneous collections.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN serializing arrays with all elements of the same type THEN the system SHALL use strongly-typed array optimization
2. WHEN serializing objects with all values of the same type THEN the system SHALL use strongly-typed object optimization
3. WHEN deserializing optimized containers THEN the system SHALL correctly parse the type and count information
4. WHEN container optimization is disabled THEN the system SHALL fall back to standard container encoding
5. IF optimization would not provide benefits THEN the system SHALL automatically choose the most efficient format

### Requirement 4

**User Story:** As a library user, I want comprehensive support for all UBJSON data types, so that I can work with any valid UBJSON data without limitations.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN working with null values THEN the system SHALL support the 'Z' type marker
2. WHEN working with boolean values THEN the system SHALL support 'T' (true) and 'F' (false) type markers
3. WHEN working with integers THEN the system SHALL support int8 ('i'), uint8 ('U'), int16 ('I'), int32 ('l'), and int64 ('L') types
4. WHEN working with floating-point numbers THEN the system SHALL support float32 ('d') and float64 ('D') types
5. WHEN working with high-precision numbers THEN the system SHALL support high-precision number ('H') type
6. WHEN working with strings THEN the system SHALL support string ('S') type with UTF-8 encoding
7. WHEN working with character values THEN the system SHALL support char ('C') type
8. WHEN working with arrays THEN the system SHALL support both standard ('[') and optimized array formats
9. WHEN working with objects THEN the system SHALL support both standard ('{') and optimized object formats

### Requirement 5

**User Story:** As a developer integrating this library, I want a clean and ergonomic API, so that I can easily serialize and deserialize data without complex boilerplate code.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN using the library THEN the system SHALL provide simple serialize/deserialize functions
2. WHEN working with custom types THEN the system SHALL support Rust's Serialize and Deserialize traits
3. WHEN errors occur THEN the system SHALL provide clear error messages with context
4. WHEN using the library THEN the system SHALL follow Rust naming conventions and best practices
5. IF users need fine-grained control THEN the system SHALL provide lower-level APIs for advanced use cases

### Requirement 6

**User Story:** As a developer concerned with data integrity, I want robust error handling and validation, so that I can safely process UBJSON data from untrusted sources.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN parsing invalid UBJSON data THEN the system SHALL detect and report format violations
2. WHEN encountering unexpected end of data THEN the system SHALL return an appropriate error
3. WHEN container lengths don't match actual content THEN the system SHALL detect and report the mismatch
4. WHEN string data contains invalid UTF-8 THEN the system SHALL handle the error gracefully
5. IF memory limits would be exceeded during parsing THEN the system SHALL prevent potential DoS attacks

### Requirement 7

**User Story:** As a performance-sensitive application developer, I want the library to be efficient in both time and memory usage, so that it doesn't become a bottleneck in my application.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN serializing large datasets THEN the system SHALL minimize memory allocations
2. WHEN deserializing data THEN the system SHALL use streaming parsing where possible
3. WHEN processing data THEN the system SHALL avoid unnecessary data copying
4. WHEN working with large containers THEN the system SHALL handle them efficiently without excessive memory overhead
5. IF zero-copy deserialization is possible THEN the system SHALL provide that option for string and binary data
